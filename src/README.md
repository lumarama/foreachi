I've noticed that often a very quick source code example is exactly what you need to move forward with your next-big-thing project. So I'll post examples that I may need to use again here.

Hope somebody will find them useful too.

You can also check some of my projects:

 - [PhotoCurves](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.foreachi.photocurves) - Color grading app with focus on RGB and HSL curves.
 - [Perfect Cast IPTV](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.niklabs.ppremote) - Watch IPTV playlists.
