I've noticed that often a very quick source code example is exactly what you need to move forward with your next-big-thing project. So I'll post examples that I may need in the future here.

Hope somebody will find them useful too.

Check some of my projects:

 - [PhotoCurves](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.foreachi.photocurves) - Color grading Android app with focus on RGB and HSL curves.
 - [Perfect Cast IPTV](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.niklabs.ppremote) - Android app for IPTV.
 - [Tentacle Wars](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fdgentertainment.tentaclewars.gp.free) - Android strategy game, also for [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tentacle-wars/id1065786902)
